If you need to create many cpmove backups for a reseller etc.
In the /home directory:
Create a users.txt file for their users which is just a list like:
user1
user2
user3
...
 
If you're on a WHM and need to copy all accounts, you can use this script to do it automatically: 
ls -al /var/cpanel/users | cut -d" " -f5 > /home/users.txt


Then create a script with:
#! /bin/bash
for i in `cat users.txt`; do /scripts/pkgacct $i; done
 
This will read the users.txt list and then package those accounts.
